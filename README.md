# BetterCryoArythmeticEngine
Mod for Starsector. Makes planet heat modifier go away. Bonuses for fleet sizes not affected.

Modifies ItemEffectsRepo, so works with any mods.

Safe to add. Not so safe to remove.
To remove it you need to manually remove EVERY cryoarithmetic engine from EVERY planet (yes, including NPC planets). After that you can remove mod.
